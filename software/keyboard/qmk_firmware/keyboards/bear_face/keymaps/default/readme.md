# default bear_face layout

This layout replaces the stock layout on the Vortex Race 3.

- Caps Lock indicator LED is enabled by default
- Layer Tap on Caps Lock (tap for Caps Lock, hold for _FN1)
- FORCE_NKRO enabled by default
- Pn key is set to 'KC_NO' by default
    * might be a good place for a macro, or to put your PC to sleep, etc.
- a combined function layer that mimics the sublegends on the stock caps (regardless of layout)
    * 'Reset' will put the keyboard into DFU mode
    * 'APP' sends 'KC_APP'
    * set base layer toggles for QWERTY, COLEMAK, and DVORAK layouts (will persist after reboot)
