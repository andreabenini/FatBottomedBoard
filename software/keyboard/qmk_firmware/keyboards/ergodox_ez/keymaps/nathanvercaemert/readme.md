# The nathanvercaemert ErgoDox EZ configuration

Centered around the home row and the use of mouse keys, this configuration focuses
on minimal finger movement. No key is more than one unit away from a finger on the home row.

## Layers

* Base Layer
  * The two main thumb keys provide a loop to the mouse key layer. Pressing the left followed by the right always guarantees that you are on the base layer.
  * There are a lot of dual function keys on the base layer.
  * The layout of the letters is qwerty.
  * Pinkys, ring fingers, and middle fingers apply dual function modifiers (along with the keys above and below the ring fingers.)
* Numbers, Symbols, and Function Keys.
  * From the base layer, many keys are dual function layer switches.
  * The switch on one hand changes the home row of the other hand to a row of symbols in most cases.
  * The left index finger, and the key below it, change the right hand to the numbers and function keys
  respectfully.
* Mouse Layer
  * Clicking the main left thumb key navigates to the mouse layer (10.) Some dual function keys (technically tap dance functions) allow the left hand to apply modifiers to mouse clicks while tapping switches to
  navigation layers.
* Navigation Layers
  * From the Mouse Layer, taps to the left home row navigate to scroll keys, arrow keys, and page keys.
