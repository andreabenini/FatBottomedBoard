# bcat's userspace

This is some code and config shared by all of [my](https://github.com/bcat)
keyboards. I have a few different keymaps spread throughout the repo; however,
they are all derived from two "canonical" keymaps for my preferred layouts:

* For typing, my canonical layout is my
[Crkbd](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/bcat)
(split ergo, columnar-staggered) layout.

* For gaming, my canonical layout is my
[Tsangan](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/layouts/community/60_tsangan_hhkb/bcat)
(row-staggered) layout.
