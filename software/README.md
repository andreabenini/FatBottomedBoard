# Keyboard firmware
- Version 1 - Based on [qmk keyboard firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) and [kbfirmware.com](kbfirmware.com) web frontend  
    Really easy to setup and generate source code, it's not fully featured like TMK but it barely works and kbfirmware.com is a fantastic
    tool without too much troubles, creating keyboard layouts from there it's a breeze.
- Version 2 - Based on [qmk keyboard firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). There's no need of kbfirmware anymore and I'm now
    focused on custom hooks and macros, always a work in progress job trying to upgrade or add new features to it
