# Keyboard firmware
- Version 1 - Based on [qmk keyboard firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) and [kbfirmware.com](kbfirmware.com) web frontend  
    Really easy to setup and generate source code, it's not fully featured like TMK but it barely works and kbfirmware.com is a fantastic
    tool without too much troubles, creating keyboard layouts from there it's a breeze.
- Version 2 - Based on [tmk keyboard firmware](https://github.com/andreabenini/tmk_keyboard)  
    The real mess is related to PIN assignment and cols/rows scanning. Firmware is so much powerful and awesome, it just needs a little
    bit of work on it. Still stick to QMK until I'll solve the real mess with this one.
