# Hardware
Buildlog and materials provided from the hardware section
- 50x50, 2mm stainless steel sheet. Got it from a surplus sale in a local hardware store. It's a poor quality and 2nd choice
  part, thin coated with cheap black paint, poorly finished. The only thing I like of it is the stainless, 2mm is fine because
  is not too thin or thick, good enough for keys and stabs mounts. Coating has to be brushed or replaced with something else.
  Really cheap part from a surplus sale cost: 5.00 €

  #2 items (for backup and tests), I'll use most of them due to my extended keyboard. #2 x 8.77$
