Hardware designs & layouts

**Note**
- keyboard-frame.png and poster-*.png files are just the temp result of keyboard-frame.eps, the could safely removed from here if needed
- **posterize.sh** splits `keyboard-frame.png` in pieces (`poster-*.png`) so they can be safely printed with 1:1 scale on common A4/US_Letter sheets
